# Claude Context for AI DNA Discovery

## Project Context System

**IMPORTANT**: A comprehensive context system exists at `/mnt/c/projects/ai-agents/misc/context-system/`

Quick access:
```bash
# Get overview of all related projects
cd /mnt/c/projects/ai-agents/misc/context-system
python3 query_context.py project ai-dna

# Search for concepts across projects
python3 query_context.py search "distributed intelligence"

# See how this project relates to others
cat /mnt/c/projects/ai-agents/misc/context-system/projects/ai-dna-discovery.md
```

## This Project's Role

AI DNA Discovery is actively exploring cross-model communication and testing how AI systems understand concepts from other projects, particularly Synchronism. Currently running autonomous multi-phase research.

## Key Relationships
- **Tests**: Synchronism concepts (Phase 2 completed)
- **Demonstrates**: Distributed intelligence in AI systems
- **Discovers**: Patterns for multi-agent coordination

## Current Status
Autonomous research program active as of July 14, 2025. Check `AUTONOMOUS_RESEARCH_PLAN.md` for current phase.
