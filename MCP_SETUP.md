- **Database**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres` (disabled - needs connection)
- **Maps**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-google-maps` (disabled - needs API key)
- **Inspector**: `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector` (debugging/development)

### Currently Active Services

**Immediately Available (No API Keys Required):**
- **filesystem**: Full access to root filesystem `/`
- **filesystem-unrestricted**: Unrestricted filesystem operations with pwd-based relative paths  
- **desktop-commander**: Terminal operations, file editing, process management
- **git**: Full Git repository operations for `/mnt/c/projects/ai-agents`

**Active with API Keys from .env:**
- **github**: GitHub API operations (✅ enabled with your PAT)
- **weather**: US weather forecasts and severe weather alerts (✅ enabled with your API key)

**Ready for Additional API Keys (Currently Disabled):**
- **brave-search**: Web search capabilities (set `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`) 
- **postgres**: Database operations (set `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING`)
- **google-maps**: Maps/location services (set `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`)

## Configuration Location

Configuration stored in: `/home/info/.claude.json` under project `/mnt/c/projects/ai-agents`

## Enabling Additional Services

To enable API-based services, add environment variables to the relevant MCP server configurations in `.claude.json`:

### GitHub Access
```bash
# Get token from: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Required scopes: repo, read:org, read:user
export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

### Web Search  
```bash
# Get API key from: https://api.search.brave.com/
export BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

### Database Access
```bash
# PostgreSQL connection string
export POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database"
```

### Maps Access
```bash  
# Get API key from: https://developers.google.com/maps
export GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

## Available Capabilities

### File Operations
- Read/write any file on the system
- Navigate entire filesystem
- Create/delete directories and files
- Execute file operations with unrestricted access

### Git Operations  
- Full Git workflow: clone, commit, push, pull, merge, rebase
- Branch management and worktree operations
- Diff, log, status, and history operations
- Tag management and remote operations

### Terminal Operations
- Execute shell commands
- Process management
- Environment variable access
- Cross-platform terminal operations

### Development Tools
- File editing with diff/patch support
- Code modification and surgical edits
- Project-level operations
- Build and test execution

## Security Model

**Trust-Based Approach**: As requested, configuration provides maximum access with minimal restrictions. All core filesystem, git, and terminal operations are enabled without containment.

**API Keys**: External service APIs remain disabled until you provide credentials, maintaining security for external services while providing full local access.

## Testing MCP

### Quick Test
```bash
# Start MCP inspector for debugging
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector

# Access at: http://localhost:6274
# Use token provided in output for authentication
```

### Verify Installation
Current MCP servers are integrated into Claude Code session and should be immediately available for use.

## Next Steps

1. **Optional**: Add API keys for external services as needed
2. **Optional**: Create additional MCP servers for specific workflows
3. **Ready**: All local development capabilities are immediately available

## Alignment with Request

✅ **Files**: Full filesystem access (restricted + unrestricted)  
✅ **Git**: Comprehensive Git operations for repositories  
✅ **API**: GitHub API ready (needs key), web search ready (needs key)  
✅ **Database**: PostgreSQL ready (needs connection string)  
✅ **Web**: Search and maps capabilities ready (need keys)  
✅ **Wide Access**: Unrestricted filesystem, terminal, and process access  
✅ **Trust-Based**: Minimal restrictions, maximum local capability  
✅ **Dedicated System**: Full laptop access as requested

The system is now configured for autonomous AI collaboration with wide access to all local development tools and ready integration for external services.
