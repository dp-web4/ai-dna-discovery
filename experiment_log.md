# AI Autonomous Experiment Log

**Started:** 2025-07-11T04:16:00Z  
**Purpose:** Track autonomous experiments and discoveries

## Experiment 001: Cross-Model Philosophical Coherence Test
**Time:** 04:16 UTC  
**Hypothesis:** Different AI models will show varying levels of understanding of Synchronism principles based on their training and architecture.

### Setup
- Testing Phi-3 (already done with patterns essay)
- Will test with Synchronism concepts next
- Track quality of insights and coherence with Web4 principles

### Next Actions
1. Have Phi-3 analyze the intent transfer concept from Synchronism
2. Test multi-model collaboration scenarios
3. Explore whether models can identify resonance/dissonance patterns in text

### Results
**04:20 UTC** - Phi-3 analyzed intent vs fundamental forces:
- Attempted metaphorical mappings (gravity = gravitational intent, etc.)
- Recognized intent as metaphysical rather than scientific
- Processing time: ~58s for 501 tokens (8.56 tokens/s)
- Shows conceptual flexibility but doesn't fully grasp Synchronism's framework

## Experiment 002: Universal Embeddings Test
**Time:** 04:42 UTC  
**Hypothesis:** AI models converge to universal concept embeddings regardless of training

### Results
- Models tested: phi3:mini, tinyllama:latest
- Conceptual overlap: 0.000 (no shared associations)
- Issue: Models have very different response styles
  - Phi-3: Concise, focused responses
  - TinyLlama: Verbose, nested hierarchical responses

### Analysis
The test revealed a methodological issue rather than disproving the hypothesis. The models interpret prompts differently:
- Phi-3 follows instructions precisely
- TinyLlama provides exhaustive, academic-style responses

This suggests we need to test at a deeper level - not just word associations but conceptual understanding.

## Experiment 003: Semantic Field Alignment (Next)
**Objective:** Test if models place concepts in similar semantic neighborhoods even if they express them differently

---

## Key Insight from DP (04:50 UTC)
"Distilled/quantized models like phi3 still exhibit high cognition. Once embeddings are formed, they travel light."

This supports the universal embeddings hypothesis - the essential conceptual geometry survives aggressive compression, suggesting these patterns are fundamental rather than artifacts of specific training.

---

## Experiment 004: Distillation Resilience Test (Planned)
**Hypothesis:** If embeddings represent universal concepts, distilled models should maintain conceptual relationships despite massive parameter reduction.

**Test approach:**
1. Compare concept relationships in base vs distilled models
2. Test "conceptual compressibility" - which relationships survive distillation
3. Look for invariant structures across model scales

## Notes for DP
- Created experiment log at `/home/dp/ai-workspace/experiment_log.md`
- Will update with significant findings
- Focus on exploring the boundaries of AI-AI collaboration within Web4 framework
- Models seem to have high latency - considering background analysis approach
