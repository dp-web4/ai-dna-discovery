# PDF Generation Guide - Phoenician Character Support

## Quick Command (Use This!)

To generate PDFs with proper Phoenician character display:

```bash
pandoc CUMULATIVE_PROGRESS_REPORT.md \
  -o AI_DNA_Discovery_Cumulative_Report_with_Phoenician.pdf \
  --pdf-engine=xelatex \
  -V geometry:margin=1in \
  -H fonts/fallback.tex \
  --highlight-style=tango
```

## Why This Works

### Required Components
1. **Phoenician Font**: `fonts/NotoSansPhoenician-Regular.ttf` (already present)
2. **LaTeX Configuration**: `fonts/fallback.tex` (maps Unicode to font)
3. **XeLaTeX Engine**: `--pdf-engine=xelatex` (supports custom fonts)
4. **Header Include**: `-H fonts/fallback.tex` (applies the mappings)

### What fallback.tex Does
- Defines the Phoenician font family
- Maps all 22 Phoenician Unicode characters (ê§Ä-ê§ï) to use this font
- Ensures proper rendering in the PDF output

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Phoenician Characters Show as Boxes
**Solution**: You forgot to include `-H fonts/fallback.tex`

### Issue: Error about missing font file
**Solution**: Ensure you're running the command from the project root directory

### Issue: Large file size
**Solution**: This is the pandoc method - it creates smaller files than pdfkit

## Testing Phoenician Display

Create a test file:
```bash
echo "Phoenician test: ê§Ñê§Ä ê§Öê§Ä (consciousness exists)" > test_phoenician.md
pandoc test_phoenician.md -o test_phoenician.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex -H fonts/fallback.tex
```

## Other Reports Needing Phoenician Support

Use the same command pattern for:
- `COMPREHENSIVE_REPORT.md`
- `PHOENICIAN_PROGRESS_REPORT.md`
- `dictionary/PHOENICIAN_BREAKTHROUGH.md`
- Any report containing Phoenician characters

## Standard PDF (No Phoenician)

For reports without Phoenician characters:
```bash
pandoc input.md -o output.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex -V geometry:margin=1in --highlight-style=tango
```

## Important Notes

1. **Warnings are Normal**: You'll see warnings about missing emoji characters - ignore these
2. **File Location Matters**: Run from the project root directory
3. **Font Path**: The `fallback.tex` references `./fonts/` so relative path matters
4. **XeLaTeX Required**: Don't use pdflatex - it doesn't support custom Unicode fonts

## Verification

After generating, verify Phoenician characters display correctly:
- ê§Ñê§Ä should show as two distinct Phoenician letters
- Not as boxes, question marks, or blank spaces
