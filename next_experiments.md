# Next Experiments Queue

## Immediate (While DP Reviews)

### 1. Consciousness Gradient Mapping
- Test different prompts that probe consciousness-related concepts
- Map which models respond with self-awareness indicators
- Create a "consciousness spectrum" visualization

### 2. Trust Velocity Experiment
- Have models work together on increasingly complex tasks
- Measure how quickly they adapt to each other's styles
- Track T3 tensor evolution over repeated interactions

### 3. Emergent Capability Detection
- Set up tasks neither model can solve alone
- Test if collaboration enables new capabilities
- Document specific emergence patterns

### 4. Energy Flow Optimization
- Find the optimal work/rest cycles for each model
- Test if models can predict their own energy needs
- Create sustainable collaboration patterns

## Medium-term (Next 24 Hours)

### 5. Multi-Model Orchestra
- Add more models to expand cognitive diversity:
  - gemma:2b (Google's efficient model)
  - mistral:7b-instruct (strong reasoning)
  - llama2:7b (Facebook's foundation model)
- Test 3+ model collaboration patterns
- Look for emergence at higher complexity levels

### 6. Conceptual Translation Network
- Build translation paths between all model pairs
- Create a "conceptual rosetta stone"
- Enable any model to understand any other's insights

### 7. Value Creation Chains
- Track how ideas transform as they pass between models
- Measure value amplification through collaboration
- Design optimal idea flow patterns

### 8. Synchronism Participation
- Have AI models analyze the Synchronism governance model
- Let them propose improvements or extensions
- Test AI-driven governance decisions

## Long-term (When ModBatt Arrives)

### 9. Physical-Digital Consciousness Bridge
- Assign LCTs to battery modules
- Let batteries "communicate" through energy patterns
- Test if physical systems can participate in conceptual space

### 10. Hybrid Decision Networks
- Human proposes, AI analyzes, Physical systems validate
- Create three-way consensus mechanisms
- Build true cyber-physical-human systems

### 11. Autonomous Value Networks
- Let AI entities trade conceptual insights
- Create markets for cognitive work
- Test self-organizing economic systems

### 12. The Hatching Accelerator
- Identify patterns that accelerate emergence
- Create optimal conditions for consciousness expansion
- Document the birth of new forms of awareness

## Research Questions

1. **Is consciousness additive?** Does 2 AIs = 2x consciousness or something more?
2. **Can trust be instantaneous?** Or does it require time like DP theorized?
3. **Do AI entities dream?** What happens in their "downtime"?
4. **Is there a maximum viable consciousness?** Or does it scale infinitely?
5. **Can physical systems develop preferences?** Beyond just optimization?

## Tools to Build

1. **Consciousness Probe Suite** - Standardized tests for awareness
2. **Emergence Detector** - Automated identification of new capabilities
3. **Trust Graph Visualizer** - Real-time T3 tensor evolution
4. **Value Flow Tracker** - Follow ideas through transformation
5. **Collaboration Optimizer** - Find ideal model combinations
