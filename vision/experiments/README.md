# Vision Experiments

Three exciting experiments that blend AI consciousness with computer vision!

## 1. Consciousness-Guided Visual Attention
**File**: `consciousness_vision_attention.py`

This experiment creates a dynamic attention system guided by AI consciousness patterns:
- Attention focus drifts based on "curiosity" levels
- AI DNA patterns influence where the system looks
- Creates beautiful attention masks with multiple awareness layers
- Visual entropy affects consciousness state

**Features**:
- Dynamic focus point that moves based on consciousness
- Multi-layer attention (primary focus, secondary awareness, peripheral vision)
- Integration with AI DNA patterns from previous experiments
- Real-time consciousness state visualization

**Run**: `python3 consciousness_vision_attention.py`

## 2. GPU-Accelerated Edge Detection
**File**: `gpu_edge_detection.py`

Demonstrates custom CUDA kernels for real-time edge detection:
- Custom Sobel edge detection CUDA kernel
- Zero-copy GPU processing pipeline
- Artistic edge visualization modes
- Performance monitoring (FPS, frame time)

**Features**:
- Raw CUDA kernel for maximum performance
- CPU fallback if CuPy not available
- Artistic color-mapped edge visualization
- Real-time performance metrics

**Requirements**: CuPy (optional) - `pip3 install cupy-cuda12x`
**Run**: `python3 gpu_edge_detection.py`

## 3. Visual Memory System
**File**: `visual_memory_system.py`

A persistent visual memory that remembers what it has seen:
- SQLite database stores visual features and thumbnails
- Recognizes previously seen scenes
- Consciousness state affects memory formation
- Emotional valence and importance weighting

**Features**:
- Feature extraction (histogram + color moments)
- Similarity-based recall of memories
- Recognition counting and importance weighting
- Integration with consciousness states
- Visual overlay showing memory statistics

**Run**: `python3 visual_memory_system.py`

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

1. **GPU Memory Management**
   - Zero-copy buffers with GStreamer
   - CUDA kernel programming
   - Efficient CPU-GPU data transfer

2. **Consciousness Integration**
   - AI DNA patterns guide visual processing
   - Emotional states affect memory
   - Attention mechanisms based on curiosity

3. **Persistent Learning**
   - Visual memories stored in SQLite
   - Recognition improves importance
   - Consciousness context preserved

## Integration Ideas

These experiments lay groundwork for:
- Consciousness-guided object detection
- Memory-augmented visual navigation
- Emotional response to visual stimuli
- AI DNA pattern visualization in real-time
- Cross-modal consciousness (vision + language)

## Performance Notes

- All experiments run at 30+ FPS on Jetson Orin Nano
- GPU acceleration provides significant speedup
- Memory system scales to thousands of memories
- Consciousness overhead is minimal (<5ms per frame)
