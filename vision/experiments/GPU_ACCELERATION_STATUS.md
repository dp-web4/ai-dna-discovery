# GPU Acceleration Status for Vision Experiments

## Current State (January 2025)

### Available GPU Technologies
1. **CUDA 12.6** - Installed and available
2. **VPI 3.2.4** - Working but limited API for our use case
3. **OpenCV 4.5.4** - NO CUDA support (CPU only)
4. **CuPy** - Not installed (no pip available)

### Working Implementations

#### 1. consciousness_attention_clean.py (Best Overall)
- **Status**: Working well, good biological model
- **GPU Usage**: NONE - All CPU operations
- **Performance**: ~20-25 FPS
- **WARNING**: CPU OPERATION - OpenCV operations

#### 2. consciousness_attention_gpu.py
- **Status**: Falls back to CPU (no CuPy)
- **GPU Usage**: NONE - CuPy not available
- **Performance**: Same as clean version
- **WARNING**: CPU OPERATION - No GPU libraries available

#### 3. consciousness_attention_vpi.py
- **Status**: Partially working with VPI
- **GPU Usage**: LIMITED - Only format conversions
- **Performance**: Similar to CPU versions
- **Note**: VPI 3.x API is limited for our motion detection needs

### GPU Utilization Analysis

**Current GPU Usage: ~0%** ðŸ˜ž

All vision processing is happening on CPU because:
1. OpenCV wasn't built with CUDA support
2. CuPy isn't installed (no pip on system)
3. VPI API doesn't expose the operations we need

### Immediate Options

1. **Use NVMM buffers** - Keep camera data in GPU memory longer
2. **Custom CUDA kernels** - Write C++ CUDA code for motion detection
3. **TensorRT** - Use neural networks for motion detection
4. **Jetson Multimedia API** - Direct GPU processing

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Option A: Neural Network Approach**
   - Use TensorRT for motion detection
   - Pre-trained models can run at 100+ FPS
   - Fully GPU accelerated

2. **Option B: Custom CUDA Implementation**
   - Write CUDA kernels for:
     - Frame differencing
     - Motion heatmap generation
     - Peak detection
   - Compile with nvcc

3. **Option C: System Configuration**
   - Install pip: `sudo apt install python3-pip`
   - Install CuPy: `pip3 install cupy-cuda12x`
   - Rebuild OpenCV with CUDA support

### Performance Impact

Current (CPU):
- Motion detection: ~20-30ms per frame
- Total pipeline: ~40-50ms (20-25 FPS)

Potential (GPU):
- Motion detection: <5ms per frame
- Total pipeline: <15ms (60+ FPS)

**We're leaving 95% of the Jetson's compute power unused!**
