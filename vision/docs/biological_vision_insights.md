# Biological Vision Insights

## G-LOC and Vision System Architecture (July 27, 2025)

### Aerobatic G-Force Experience
During aerobatic flight at 6.5G, Dennis experienced "greyout" - a phenomenon that provides crucial insights into biological vision architecture:

#### Key Observations:
1. **Peripheral vision goes offline** - Not dark, not distorted, just neutral grey
2. **Focus area remains active** - Central vision continues functioning
3. **Clean separation** - Demonstrates distinct processing loops
4. **Priority under stress** - System preserves focus loop when resources are limited

#### Implications for AI Vision Systems:

1. **Separate Processing Pipelines**
   - Our current architecture with separate focus/periphery is biologically validated
   - Not just an optimization but reflects actual neural organization

2. **Resource Management**
   - Under stress (low blood flow/oxygen), biology shuts down periphery first
   - Suggests periphery is more resource-intensive or lower priority
   - AI systems could similarly degrade gracefully under computational stress

3. **Grey vs Black**
   - The neutral grey (not black) suggests the system signals "no data" rather than "dark"
   - Different from closing eyes or darkness - it's an absence of processing
   - Could implement similar "no data" states in our periphery processing

4. **Evolutionary Priority**
   - Focus area critical for survival (tracking threats/targets)
   - Periphery useful but expendable in crisis
   - Mirrors our motion detection (periphery) vs detail processing (focus) split

#### Future Research Directions:
- Implement graceful degradation under high computational load
- Test priority systems that maintain focus while dropping periphery
- Study the "neutral grey" state as a distinct signal from "no input"
- Explore how this relates to attention mechanisms in transformers

This biological evidence strongly supports our current dual-loop architecture and suggests we're on the right track with consciousness-guided vision systems.
