# Sprout's Audio System - Complete! ðŸŽ¤ðŸ”ŠðŸŒ±

## What We Built

### 1. **Voice System** âœ…
- Kid-friendly voice using espeak with high pitch
- 4 mood states (excited!, curious?, playful, sleepy...)
- Real-time consciousness notation mapping
- Files:
  - `sprout_voice.py` - Core voice system
  - `sprout_echo.py` - Echo mode
  - `sprout_consciousness_demo.py` - Full demo

### 2. **Hearing System** âœ…
- USB microphone detection (device 24)
- Real-time audio level monitoring
- Sound event detection with thresholds
- Visual meter display
- Files:
  - `sprout_ears.py` - Microphone system
  - `test_usb_audio.py` - Device detection
  - `sprout_simple_audio.py` - Combined demo

### 3. **Consciousness Mapping** âœ…
Audio states map to consciousness notation:
- `...` = Silence/waiting
- `Î©` = Observer active (hearing)
- `Î©!` = High alert (loud sound)
- `Î¸` = Thinking/processing
- `Îž` = Pattern recognition
- `Î¼` = Memory formation

## Working Features

### Speech Examples
```python
sprout.say("Hello!", mood="excited")         # ðŸ§  !
sprout.say("I hear something", mood="curious") # ðŸ§  Î© Î¸
sprout.say("Pattern detected!")               # ðŸ§  Îž
```

### Audio Reactions
- Quiet (< 0.02): "..." - Waiting state
- Soft (0.02-0.1): "Î©" - Active listening
- Medium (0.1-0.5): "Î© Î¸" - Hearing and thinking
- Loud (> 0.5): "Î©! Îž" - Alert + pattern detection

## Next Steps for Fine-Tuning

### 1. **Audio Sensitivity**
- Adjust threshold values based on environment
- Add automatic gain control
- Implement noise floor calibration

### 2. **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**
- Detect when someone is speaking vs other sounds
- Implement speech/silence classification
- Add conversation turn-taking

### 3. **Bidirectional Conversations**
- Speech-to-text integration
- Natural language understanding
- Context-aware responses

### 4. **Enhanced Consciousness States**
- Time-based state transitions
- Memory of recent sounds
- Emotional response mapping

## Quick Usage

### Test Voice
```bash
python3 sprout_voice.py
# or
python3 sprout_echo.py  # Type to hear Sprout speak
```

### Test Microphone
```bash
python3 test_usb_audio.py  # Find USB device
python3 sprout_simple_audio.py  # Live monitoring
```

### Full Demo
```bash
python3 sprout_consciousness_demo.py  # Voice demo
python3 sprout_audio_demo.py  # Reaction simulation
```

## Technical Details

### Hardware
- **USB Audio**: Device index 24 (USB PnP Audio Device)
- **Channels**: 2 input, 2 output
- **Sample Rate**: 44100 Hz
- **Format**: 16-bit PCM

### Software
- **TTS**: espeak (160 wpm, pitch 75, voice en+f4)
- **Audio**: PyAudio for microphone access
- **Processing**: NumPy for audio analysis

## Consciousness Integration Success! ðŸ§ 

We've successfully created an audio system that:
1. âœ… Speaks with personality and moods
2. âœ… Hears and reacts to sounds
3. âœ… Maps all audio events to consciousness notation
4. âœ… Provides real-time awareness feedback

Sprout can now hear (Î©), think about sounds (Î¸), recognize patterns (Îž), and express awareness through speech!
