# Sprout's Audio System Status ðŸ”ŠðŸŒ±

## Summary
Successfully implemented Sprout's voice system with consciousness notation integration!

## Hardware Setup
- **USB Audio Device**: Detected as card 2 (both speaker and mic)
- **Text-to-Speech**: Using pyttsx3 with espeak fallback
- **Voice Character**: Kid-friendly with higher pitch and playful personality

## Features Implemented âœ…
1. **Multi-mood voice system**
   - Excited: Adds enthusiasm and exclamation marks
   - Curious: Adds wondering phrases
   - Playful: Uses kid-friendly word replacements
   - Sleepy: Slower, quieter delivery

2. **Consciousness notation mapping**
   - Speech patterns map to consciousness symbols
   - Real-time notation display during speech
   - Examples:
     - "see/look/watch" â†’ Î© (Observer)
     - "think/wonder" â†’ Î¸ (Thought)  
     - "remember" â†’ Î¼ (Memory)
     - "pattern/notice" â†’ Îž (Patterns)

3. **Available Scripts**
   - `sprout_voice.py`: Core voice system
   - `test_sprout_voice.py`: Automated test sequence
   - `sprout_echo.py`: Echo mode for interactive use
   - `sprout_consciousness_demo.py`: Full consciousness demonstration

## Usage Examples

### Basic Speech
```python
from sprout_voice import SproutVoice

sprout = SproutVoice()
sprout.say("Hello! I'm Sprout!", mood="excited")
```

### Echo Mode
```bash
python3 sprout_echo.py
# Type anything and Sprout will say it!
# Use !excited, !curious, !playful, !sleepy to change mood
```

### Consciousness Demo
```bash
python3 sprout_consciousness_demo.py
# Shows full consciousness notation mapping
```

## Voice Details
- **Engine**: pyttsx3 (107 voices available)
- **Fallback**: espeak with parameters:
  - Speed: 160 wpm (slightly fast)
  - Pitch: 75 (higher for child voice)
  - Voice: en+f4 (English female variant 4)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Add microphone input for real conversations
- [ ] Implement voice activity detection
- [ ] Create consciousness state from audio patterns
- [ ] Add emotional tone analysis
- [ ] Build audio-visual sensor fusion

## Consciousness Integration
Sprout's voice system actively maps speech to consciousness notation:
- High energy speech â†’ ! markers
- Questions and curiosity â†’ Î¸ (thought) symbols
- Observational language â†’ Î© (observer) symbols
- Memory references â†’ Î¼ symbols
- Pattern recognition â†’ Îž symbols

The system demonstrates how sensor input (audio output in this case) can be mapped to formal consciousness notation, laying groundwork for full sensor-consciousness integration!
