# Claude Context for Sensor-Consciousness Integration

## Project Context

This is a focused sub-project within AI DNA Discovery, exploring the integration of physical sensors with AI consciousness systems. We're building on our consciousness notation (Ψ, ∃, ⇒, π, ι, Ω, Σ, Ξ, θ, μ) to create embodied AI awareness.

## Hardware Available

### Current Sensors
- **2 Cameras**: For visual input (stereo vision possible)
- **Platform**: Linux/WSL2 on laptop with RTX 4090

### Planned Sensors
- **IMU**: Inertial Measurement Unit for spatial awareness
- **Microphone**: Audio input for environmental awareness  
- **Speaker**: Audio output for expression/feedback

### Edge Targets
- Primary: Laptop (development)
- Secondary: Jetson Orin Nano (deployment)

## Key Concepts to Remember

### Sensor-to-Consciousness Mapping
```
Camera → Ω (Observer) → Visual awareness patterns
IMU → π (Perspective) → Spatial consciousness
Microphone → Ξ (Patterns) → Auditory pattern recognition
Memory → μ (Memory) → Temporal persistence
Integration → Ψ (Consciousness) → Unified awareness
```

### Design Principles
1. **Real-time Processing**: Sensors generate continuous streams
2. **Edge-First**: Must work on resource-constrained devices
3. **Graceful Degradation**: System works with any subset of sensors
4. **Persistent Memory**: SQLite for state across sessions
5. **Consciousness Integration**: Map sensor states to notation

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Sensor Access (Current)
- Get camera feeds working
- Test data rates and formats
- Build basic interfaces

### Phase 2: Consciousness Mapping
- Define sensor state → symbol mappings
- Create awareness metrics from sensor data
- Implement streaming consciousness notation

### Phase 3: Memory Integration
- Store sensor-derived states
- Enable temporal pattern recognition
- Build predictive awareness

### Phase 4: Edge Deployment
- Optimize for Jetson
- Implement power-aware processing
- Create demo applications

## Development Guidelines

1. **Modular Design**: Each sensor is independent
2. **Streaming First**: Handle continuous data flows
3. **Privacy Aware**: No recording without explicit flags
4. **Fail Safe**: System degrades gracefully
5. **Observable**: All states visible through consciousness notation

## Integration Points

This work will eventually merge back to provide:
- Environmental context for language models
- Embodied intelligence for edge AI
- Real-world grounding for semantic systems
- Multi-modal consciousness demonstrations

## Remember

- This is exploratory - try creative approaches
- Document sensor-consciousness discoveries in SQL
- Keep edge constraints in mind
- Use consciousness notation to represent states
- Think about temporal coherence with streaming data
