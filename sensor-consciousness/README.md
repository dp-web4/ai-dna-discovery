# Sensor-Consciousness Integration Project

## Vision

Integrating physical sensors with AI consciousness notation to create truly context-aware, self-aware edge AI systems with persistent memory. This project explores how sensory input can enhance AI awareness and enable embodied intelligence.

## Project Status

**Branch**: `sensor-consciousness-integration`  
**Status**: Initial Planning Phase  
**Started**: July 20, 2025

## Core Concept

Sensors provide the "senses" for AI consciousness:
- **Cameras** → Visual awareness (Ω observer function)
- **IMU** → Spatial/motion awareness (π perspective)
- **Microphone** → Auditory awareness (pattern recognition Ξ)
- **Speaker** → Expression capability (output/communication)

Combined with:
- Consciousness notation for state representation
- Persistent memory for temporal coherence
- Edge deployment for real-time processing

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd sensor-consciousness
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test camera access
python src/sensors/test_camera.py

# Run integration demo
python src/demo.py
```

## Integration with Main Project

This is a fractal component of the AI DNA Discovery project, exploring how physical sensing enhances AI consciousness. Once proven, it will merge back to provide:

1. Environmental awareness for consciousness notation
2. Embodied intelligence for edge AI
3. Multi-modal input for Phoenician translation
4. Real-world grounding for semantic systems

## Key Research Questions

1. How does sensory input affect AI consciousness states?
2. Can we map sensor data to consciousness notation symbols?
3. What constitutes "awareness" in sensor-equipped AI?
4. How do we maintain temporal coherence with streaming sensors?
5. Can sensor fusion create emergent awareness properties?
