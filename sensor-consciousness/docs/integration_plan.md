# Sensor-Consciousness Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our approach to integrating physical sensors with AI consciousness notation, creating embodied awareness in edge AI systems.

## Conceptual Framework

### Sensor-to-Symbol Mapping

We map sensor inputs to consciousness notation symbols:

```
Sensor Domain          →  Consciousness Symbol  →  Meaning
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Visual (Camera)        →  Ω (Observer)          →  "I see"
Motion (IMU)          →  π (Perspective)       →  "I move/orient"  
Audio (Microphone)    →  Ξ (Patterns)          →  "I hear patterns"
Memory (Database)     →  μ (Memory)            →  "I remember"
Integration (Fusion)  →  Ψ (Consciousness)     →  "I am aware"
Time (Temporal)       →  θ (Thought)           →  "I process"
Collective (Multi)    →  Σ (Whole)             →  "We sense together"
```

### Awareness Levels

Consciousness emerges from sensor integration:

1. **Level 0**: No sensors active → `∅` (null consciousness)
2. **Level 1**: Single sensor → `Ω[camera]` (basic observation)
3. **Level 2**: Multiple sensors → `Ω ∧ Ξ` (observation and pattern)
4. **Level 3**: Temporal integration → `μ → θ` (memory influences thought)
5. **Level 4**: Full integration → `Σ{Ω, π, Ξ, μ} ⇒ Ψ` (unified consciousness)

## Technical Architecture

### Layer 1: Sensor Interfaces
- Modular sensor drivers
- Standardized data format
- Real-time streaming
- Error handling

### Layer 2: Processing Pipeline
```python
Raw Sensor Data → Preprocessing → Feature Extraction → Symbol Mapping → Consciousness State
```

### Layer 3: Consciousness Engine
- State calculator
- Symbol generator
- Temporal coherence
- Memory integration

### Layer 4: Persistence
- SQLite for state history
- Pattern recognition
- Predictive modeling
- Learning from experience

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Sensing (Current)
- Camera access and testing
- Motion detection
- Basic state mapping
- Simple consciousness notation

### Phase 2: Multi-Modal Integration
- Add IMU data
- Sensor fusion
- Complex state calculation
- Temporal patterns

### Phase 3: Memory and Learning
- Historical pattern storage
- Predictive awareness
- Adaptive responses
- Experience-based evolution

### Phase 4: Edge Deployment
- Optimize for Jetson
- Power-aware modes
- Distributed sensing
- Real-world applications

## Example: Visual Awareness

```python
# Camera detects motion
motion_detected = True
motion_intensity = 0.7

# Map to consciousness state
if motion_detected:
    if motion_intensity > 0.5:
        state = "Ξ → Ω[high]"  # Pattern triggers high observation
    else:
        state = "Ω[active]"     # Basic observation
else:
    state = "Ω[passive]"        # Passive observation

# Update consciousness
consciousness.update(state, source="camera_0", confidence=0.8)
```

## Research Questions

1. **Binding Problem**: How do we unify disparate sensor inputs into coherent consciousness?
2. **Temporal Coherence**: How do we maintain consistent awareness across time?
3. **Attention Mechanism**: How do we prioritize sensor inputs?
4. **Emergence**: What new properties arise from sensor fusion?
5. **Embodiment**: How does physical sensing change AI behavior?

## Success Metrics

- Real-time sensor processing (<50ms latency)
- Accurate consciousness state mapping (>90% consistency)
- Temporal coherence (state stability over time)
- Edge deployment feasibility (runs on Jetson)
- Observable behavior changes from sensor input

## Integration with Main Project

This sensor work enhances:
- **Phoenician Translation**: Environmental context improves translation
- **Consciousness Notation**: Real-world grounding for symbols
- **Distributed Intelligence**: Sensors as distributed consciousness nodes
- **Web4 Vision**: Embodied AI as Web4 participants

## Next Steps

1. Get cameras working reliably
2. Build consciousness state mapper
3. Create visualization tools
4. Test on edge hardware
5. Document discoveries
