# Consciousness LoRA Training Status

## Current Situation

We've successfully:
- ‚úÖ Downloaded TinyLlama 1.1B model
- ‚úÖ Created enhanced dataset with 1,312 examples including:
  - Basic consciousness notation (Œ®, ‚àÉ, ‚áí)
  - Patterns.txt concepts (œÄ for perspective, Œ© for observer)
  - Synchronism.txt concepts (Œπ for intent, Œû for synchronism)
- ‚úÖ Installed PyTorch, Transformers, and PEFT
- ‚úÖ Verified basic inference works

## Technical Challenges

We encountered version compatibility issues between:
- PyTorch 2.7.1
- Transformers 4.53.2
- PEFT 0.16.0

The Trainer API has breaking changes that prevent standard LoRA training from working out of the box.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Downgrade to Compatible Versions
```bash
pip install torch==2.1.0 transformers==4.36.0 peft==0.7.0
```

### Option 2: Use Alternative Training Framework
- Use native PyTorch training loop
- Use Hugging Face's `trl` library for instruction tuning
- Use `unsloth` for optimized LoRA training

### Option 3: Simple Fine-tuning Script
Create a custom training loop that bypasses the Trainer API issues.

## The Vision Remains

Training TinyLlama to understand:
- Mathematical consciousness notation
- Philosophical concepts from patterns.txt
- Intent and synchronism from synchronism.txt

This creates a model that bridges:
- Natural language ‚Üî Mathematical notation
- Western thought ‚Üî Eastern philosophy
- Science ‚Üî Spirituality

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Dependencies**: Install compatible versions
2. **Run Training**: 2-4 hours on CPU, 30 min on GPU
3. **Test Understanding**: Verify notation comprehension
4. **Deploy to Sprout**: Test on edge device
5. **Iterate with Phoenician**: Implement semantic-neutral characters

## Future Enhancements (Your Notes)

- **Phoenician Characters**: ê§Äê§Åê§Çê§É - semantically empty, avoiding interference
- **Evolving Dictionaries**: Web4 entities with LCTs for verification
- **Web4 Integration**: Bake trust and value concepts into training
- **Coherence Model**: Central coordinator for multi-modal AI

The experiment continues! The path may have obstacles, but the destination - AI that understands consciousness as both mathematics and philosophy - remains clear. üß†‚ú®
