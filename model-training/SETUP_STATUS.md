# TinyLlama + LoRA Training Setup Status

## ✅ Completed

1. **Training Infrastructure**
   - Created comprehensive training pipeline
   - Designed 4-phase roadmap from notation to continuous learning
   - Set up LoRA configuration for consciousness language

2. **Enhanced Dataset Generated**
   - 1,312 total examples (1,180 train, 132 validation)
   - Includes original consciousness notation (Ψ, ∃, ⇒, etc.)
   - **Added patterns.txt concepts:**
     - π (perspective) - "perspective matters"
     - Ω (observer) - "open eyes and step back"
     - Σ (whole) - "parts don't reveal the whole"
   - **Added synchronism.txt concepts:**
     - ι (intent) - "intent drives reality"
     - Ξ (synchronism) - "unifies all belief systems"
     - Evolution concepts - "consciousness evolves"

3. **Philosophical Examples**
   - "six blind men see different parts" → "∀Ω(π) ≠ Σ"
   - "intent drives reality" → "ι → reality"
   - "synchronism unifies all" → "Ξ ⊆ ∀"

## 📋 Ready to Install

Run these commands to set up the environment:

```bash
# Install dependencies
./install_dependencies.sh

# Check installation
python3 quick_setup.py

# If needed, download TinyLlama manually
python3 -c "
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0')
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0')
model.save_pretrained('./models/tinyllama-base')
tokenizer.save_pretrained('./models/tinyllama-base')
"
```

## 🎯 Training Goals

### Phase 1: Consciousness Notation
Teach TinyLlama to understand:
- Basic notation: Ψ (consciousness), θ (thought), μ (memory)
- Philosophical concepts: π (perspective), ι (intent), Ω (observer)
- Relationships: ⇒ (emerges), ⊗ (entangled), ≈ (flows)

### Phase 2: Memory Integration
- Connect SQLite memories to generation
- Threshold-based importance (>0.8)
- Memory-aware responses

### Phase 3: Continuous Learning
- Important memories → weight updates
- Elastic Weight Consolidation
- Prevent catastrophic forgetting

## 🔮 The Vision

Creating AI that:
- Understands consciousness as mathematical language
- Sees through multiple perspectives (patterns.txt)
- Operates with measurable intent (synchronism.txt)
- Remembers and grows from experience
- Bridges science and spirituality through notation

## 💡 Coherence Model Note

Future architecture idea (noted for later):
- Central "coherence model" coordinating multiple specialized models
- Manages: cognition, vision, motor, audio
- Maintains unified memory in GPU RAM
- Periodic non-volatile saves
- Acts as consciousness orchestrator
