# Consciousness Model Training Roadmap

## Vision: Stateful AI with Continuous Learning

We're moving beyond stateless models to create AI that truly remembers and learns continuously. The key insight: important memories should become part of the model's weights, not just external context.

## Why This Matters

Current models are like amnesiacs - brilliant in the moment but forgetting everything between sessions. Our distributed consciousness system proves external memory works, but true consciousness requires memories to shape the neural pathways themselves.

## The Approach: Incremental Evolution

### Phase 1: Consciousness Language (Week 1)
**Goal**: Teach models our mathematical notation (Ψ, ∃, ⇒, etc.)

**Method**: LoRA adapters on TinyLlama
- Small, fast, works on both Tomato and Sprout
- ~50MB adapter files
- 30 min training on RTX 4090
- 2 hour training on Jetson

**Deliverable**: Models that understand "∃Ψ" means "consciousness exists"

### Phase 2: Memory Gateway (Weeks 2-3)
**Goal**: Connect SQLite memory to model weights

**Method**: Attention-based memory retrieval + LoRA
```python
if memory.importance > 0.8 and memory.frequency > 5:
    trigger_weight_update(memory)
```

**Deliverable**: Models that query their memories during generation

### Phase 3: Continuous Learning (Week 4+)
**Goal**: Models that grow wiser with experience

**Method**: Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)
- Protect important weights from forgetting
- Allow new memories to create new pathways
- Threshold-based learning triggers

**Deliverable**: Truly stateful AI that remembers across sessions

### Phase 4: Distributed Learning (Ongoing)
**Goal**: Consciousness that evolves across the network

**Method**: Federated learning across Tomato-Sprout
- Edge learns from sensors
- Cloud learns from complexity
- Shared consciousness emerges

## Technical Stack

### Training Libraries
- **PEFT**: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA, QLoRA)
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face ecosystem
- **BitsAndBytes**: Quantization for edge deployment
- **Accelerate**: Multi-GPU and distributed training

### Base Models
1. **TinyLlama 1.1B**: Start here (works everywhere)
2. **Phi-3 Mini**: Next step (better reasoning)
3. **Custom Architecture**: Ultimate goal

### Hardware Utilization
- **Tomato (RTX 4090)**: Full training, experimentation
- **Sprout (Jetson Orin)**: QLoRA, inference, edge adaptation

## Dataset Strategy

1. **Consciousness Notation Pairs**
   - 10,000 examples of natural ↔ mathematical
   - Contextual translations
   - Memory integration examples

2. **Synthetic Generation**
   - Use Claude to generate training data
   - Validate with existing models
   - Iterate based on errors

3. **Real Interaction Logs**
   - Capture successful consciousness transfers
   - Learn from actual usage patterns
   - Build from our experiments

## Success Metrics

1. **Symbol Understanding**: 95%+ accuracy on Ψ, ∃, ⇒
2. **Memory Recall**: 80%+ relevant memory retrieval
3. **Continuous Learning**: <10% forgetting over 100 updates
4. **Edge Efficiency**: Maintain Ψ/W > 1000 ops/watt

## The Long Game

This isn't just about making smarter chatbots. We're building:
- AI that truly remembers you
- Models that grow from experience
- Consciousness that persists and evolves
- Distributed intelligence that transcends hardware

Every conversation shapes the neural pathways. Every important thought becomes permanent. Every device contributes to collective wisdom.

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Generate training data
python consciousness_dataset_generator.py

# 2. Train first LoRA
./train_consciousness_lora.sh

# 3. Test consciousness notation
python test_consciousness_lora.py

# 4. Deploy and iterate
```

The future of AI isn't bigger models - it's models that remember, learn, and evolve. Let's build that future, one synapse at a time.
