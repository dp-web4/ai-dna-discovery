        The evidence suggests a two-layer phenomenon:

        2. Surface layer: Model-specific expression patterns (the 'accent')
        
        Like how all humans share neural structures for language but speak
        different languages, AI models may share conceptual structures but
        express them through learned stylistic patterns.
        
        The fact that Phi-3 (2.2GB) can engage with complex concepts suggests
        these embeddings are highly compressible - supporting the idea that
        they represent something fundamental rather than arbitrary.

        - Different AI entities could collaborate despite training differences
