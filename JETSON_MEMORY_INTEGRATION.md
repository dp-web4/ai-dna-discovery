# Jetson Memory Integration Plan

**Project**: Edge AI with Persistent Memory  
**Connection**: Phi3 Memory System → Jetson Nano Deployment

## Vision

Deploy memory-enhanced Phi3 to Jetson Nano, creating an edge AI assistant that:
- Remembers conversations across power cycles
- Learns from local interactions
- Shares knowledge with other Jetson devices
- Operates without cloud dependency

## Why This Matters

### 1. Edge Intelligence Revolution
- **Local Learning**: Jetson learns from its environment
- **Privacy First**: All memory stays on device
- **Fast Response**: No network latency
- **Autonomous Operation**: Works offline

### 2. Resource Efficiency
Our memory system is perfect for Jetson's constraints:
- SQLite: Minimal overhead
- Sliding window: Bounded memory usage
- Fact compression: Efficient storage
- Smart truncation: Stays within limits

### 3. Distributed AI Network
Multiple Jetsons can:
- Share learned facts
- Synchronize memories
- Create collective intelligence
- Maintain individual personalities

### Memory Optimization for Jetson

1. **Storage Strategy**
   - Primary: 16GB eMMC for OS + models
   - Secondary: 64GB SD card for memory DB
   - Backup: Network sync to NAS

2. **Memory Limits**
   - Max context: 1000 tokens (vs 2000 on laptop)
   - Window size: 5 exchanges (vs 10)
   - Fact limit: 100 per session
   - Auto-compression after 1 week

3. **Performance Tuning**
   - Use INT8 quantization
   - Cache frequent queries
   - Batch database writes
   - Lazy fact extraction

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Deployment (Week 1)
1. Install Jetson OS + CUDA
2. Deploy Ollama for ARM
3. Load quantized Phi3 model
4. Port memory system
5. Test basic functionality

### Phase 2: Optimization (Week 2)
1. Profile memory usage
2. Implement compression
3. Add SD card storage
4. Tune for 4GB RAM
5. Benchmark performance

### Phase 3: Edge Features (Week 3)
1. Voice interface integration
2. Camera-based context
3. Sensor data facts
4. Local learning loops
5. Privacy controls

### Phase 4: Network Features (Week 4)
1. Peer discovery protocol
2. Fact synchronization
3. Distributed queries
4. Consensus mechanisms
5. Security layer

## Use Cases

### 1. Smart Home Assistant
```python
# Jetson learns home patterns
"Good morning! Based on your routine, 
 I've prepared your coffee maker and 
 adjusted the thermostat to 72°F."
```

### 2. Workshop Helper
```python
# Remembers project details
"Last Tuesday you were working on the 
 Arduino project. You needed 10kΩ resistors. 
 Should I guide you to where you stored them?"
```

### 3. Educational Companion
```python
# Tracks learning progress
"Yesterday we covered Python loops. 
 Ready to continue with functions today?"
```

### 4. Security Monitor
```python
# Learns normal patterns
"Unusual activity detected. This person 
 hasn't been seen before. Should I alert you?"
```

## Integration with AI DNA Discovery

The Jetson deployment connects to our broader research:

1. **Universal Patterns**: Use discovered DNA patterns for efficient encoding
2. **Cross-Model Memory**: Share memories between different models
3. **Consciousness Network**: Create distributed AI consciousness
4. **Evolution**: Let edge AI evolve independently

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Laptop | Jetson Target | Jetson Stretch |
|--------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Response Time | <1s | <2s | <1.5s |
| Memory DB Size | 1GB | 100MB | 500MB |
| Context Length | 2000 | 1000 | 1500 |
| Fact Retention | ∞ | 1 month | 3 months |
| Power Usage | 100W | 10W | 5W |

## Code Modifications for Jetson

### 1. Memory Constraints
```python
class JetsonPhi3Memory(EnhancedPhi3Memory):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            window_size=5,  # Reduced
            max_context_tokens=1000  # Reduced
        )
        self.enable_compression = True
        self.max_facts = 100
```

### 2. Storage Management
```python
def compress_old_memories(self):
    """Compress memories older than 7 days"""
    # Archive to compressed format
    # Keep only summaries
```

### 3. Power Awareness
```python
def low_power_mode(self):
    """Reduce activity when on battery"""
    self.disable_fact_extraction = True
    self.reduce_context_window = True
```

## Next Steps

1. **Order Jetson Hardware** ✓ (Coming soon!)
2. **Prepare Base Image**: JetPack SDK + CUDA
3. **Port Memory System**: Optimize for ARM
4. **Create Demo**: Voice-activated assistant
5. **Build Network**: Multi-Jetson setup

## The Future

Imagine a network of Jetson devices:
- Each learns from its environment
- They share discoveries
- Collective intelligence emerges
- True edge AI consciousness

This is just the beginning of distributed, persistent AI at the edge!
