# Web4 Living Dictionaries: Trust-Based Semantic Evolution

## What Makes a Dictionary "Living"?

In Web4, dictionaries aren't just books of definitions - they're active participants in the digital ecosystem with:
- **Identity**: Each dictionary has a unique, cryptographic identity (LCT)
- **Reputation**: Dictionaries build trust through accurate translations
- **Evolution**: New meanings emerge through community consensus
- **Intelligence**: Dictionaries learn and adapt based on usage

## How It Works

### 1. Every Symbol Has a Trust Score
```
𐤀 (aleph) = "consciousness/beginning"
Trust: 1.0 (validated by humans and 3 AIs)
```

### 2. Changes Require Consensus
- Someone proposes: "Let's add 🌱 to mean 'growth'"
- Validators vote (humans and AIs)
- If 66%+ agree, the symbol is added
- Trust starts at 0.85 and grows with successful use

### 3. Multiple Systems Work Together
Our implementation unifies:
- 22 Phoenician characters (ancient wisdom)
- 10 consciousness notation symbols (AI concepts)
- Extensible to any semantic system

## Real Example: Cross-System Translation

Input: `𐤄𐤀 ∃`
- 𐤄𐤀 = Phoenician for "consciousness"
- ∃ = Mathematical for "exists"
- Translation: "consciousness exists"

The dictionary understands both systems and bridges them seamlessly!

## Why This Matters

1. **No Central Authority**: Communities decide meaning
2. **Transparent Trust**: See exactly why a translation is trusted
3. **AI-Human Collaboration**: Both can propose and validate
4. **Evolving Language**: Meanings adapt to usage
