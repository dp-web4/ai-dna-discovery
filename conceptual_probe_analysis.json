Surface layer: Model-specific expression patterns (the 'accent')\n        \n        Like how all humans share neural structures for language but speak\n        different languages, AI models may share conceptual structures but\n        express them through learned stylistic patterns.\n        \n        The fact that Phi-3 (2.2GB) can engage with complex concepts suggests\n        these embeddings are highly compressible - supporting the idea that\n        they represent something fundamental rather than arbitrary.\n        ",
