# Phase 2: Model Weight Analysis Guide

## Tools for Analyzing Model Internals

### 1. WeightWatcher
**Purpose**: Analyze neural network weight quality without training data  
**Installation**: `pip install weightwatcher`  
**Key Features**:
- Predicts model accuracy from weight matrices alone
- Detects overtraining (alpha < 2.0)
- Quality metrics: alpha, alpha-hat, stable rank
- Best models have alpha between 2-6

**Usage Example**:
```python
import weightwatcher as ww
watcher = ww.WeightWatcher(model=model)
results = watcher.analyze()
summary = watcher.get_summary()
```

### 2. Captum (PyTorch)
**Purpose**: Model interpretability and layer/neuron analysis  
**Installation**: `pip install captum`  
**Key Features**:
- Layer attribution methods
- Neuron importance analysis
- Activation visualization
- Integrated gradients

### 3. Ollama-Specific Weight Stability Test
**Purpose**: Detect weight changes in Ollama models through behavioral analysis  
**Method**: Since Ollama uses GGUF format and API access, we analyze:
- Embedding consistency (identical inputs → identical outputs)
- Response time stability
- Fingerprinting embeddings for exact comparison

## Implementation Strategy for AI DNA Discovery

### Challenge: Ollama Model Access
Ollama models are:
- In GGUF format (not PyTorch .pt files)
- Accessed via API (not direct weight access)
- Potentially quantized (int4/int8)

### Solution: Behavioral Weight Analysis

#### 1. **Embedding Fingerprinting**
```python
# Create unique fingerprint for each embedding
embedding = get_embedding(model, pattern)
fingerprint = hashlib.sha256(embedding.tobytes()).hexdigest()

# If fingerprints match → weights unchanged
# If fingerprints differ → weights may have changed
```

#### 2. **Stability Metrics**
- **Perfect Stability**: Same input always produces identical embedding
- **Drift Detection**: Measure cosine similarity over time
- **Latency Profiling**: Changes in response time may indicate weight updates

#### 3. **Memory Effect Testing**
Test sequences:
- Repeated pattern: `['emerge'] * 20`
- Mixed patterns: `['emerge', 'true', 'loop'] * 5`
- Novel introduction: `['emerge'] * 10 + ['quantum'] + ['emerge'] * 10`

## Phase 2 Weight Analysis Protocol

### Experiment 1: Baseline Weight Stability
1. Select test patterns (perfect, novel, nonsense)
2. Get embeddings 10 times for each pattern
3. Compare fingerprints - should be identical
4. Calculate drift metrics

### Experiment 2: Memory Formation vs Weights
1. Test pattern recognition speed over time
2. Monitor if embeddings remain constant
3. If weights stable + recognition faster = true memory
4. If weights change = learning/adaptation

### Experiment 3: Cross-Pattern Weight Effects
1. Test if recognizing pattern A affects pattern B's embedding
2. Map embedding space relationships
3. Detect weight interconnections

## Expected Outcomes

### Scenario 1: Weights Remain Constant
- All embeddings perfectly reproducible
- Memory is activation-based, not weight-based
- Confirms architectural memory hypothesis

### Scenario 2: Weights Show Micro-Changes
- Small embedding drift over time
- Possible online learning or adaptation
- Need to quantify change magnitude

### Scenario 3: Pattern-Specific Changes
- Some patterns stable, others drift
- Suggests selective weight updates
- Map which patterns trigger changes

## Integration with Current Findings

Our Phase 1 discoveries suggest:
- 40+ patterns with perfect recognition
- No memory decay over 500+ cycles
- Immediate recognition (innate knowledge)

Weight analysis will reveal if this is due to:
1. **Static Architecture**: Weights never change, patterns are hardcoded
2. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Weights subtly adjust to reinforce patterns
3. **Hybrid System**: Core weights stable, peripheral weights adaptive

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install tools
pip install weightwatcher captum

# Run Ollama weight stability test
python3 ollama_weight_stability_test.py

# Analyze model weights (if accessible)
python3 model_weight_analyzer.py
```

## Key Insights

1. **Ollama's Architecture** requires behavioral analysis over direct weight inspection
2. **Embedding Fingerprinting** provides exact change detection
3. **Response Consistency** serves as proxy for weight stability
4. **Memory without Weight Changes** would confirm architectural memory hypothesis
