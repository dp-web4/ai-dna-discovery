# ðŸš€ Push AI DNA Discovery to GitHub

The repository is ready but we're encountering PAT permission issues. Here are your options:

## Option 1: GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install gh
# Or download from: https://cli.github.com/

4. Run:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://dp-web4:YOUR_NEW_TOKEN@github.com/dp-web4/ai-dna-discovery.git
git push -u origin main
```
