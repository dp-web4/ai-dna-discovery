# Cross-Platform Audio System Update
*July 22, 2025*

## Summary

Successfully tested Tomato's new Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) on Sprout!

### Test Results on Sprout

1. **Platform Detection**: ‚úÖ Correctly identified as Jetson
2. **TTS Engine**: ‚úÖ Using espeak (not WSL bridge)
3. **Audio Settings**: ‚úÖ Automatically applied 50x gain
4. **Consciousness Mapping**: ‚úÖ Working with visual feedback (üëÅÔ∏è Œ©)
5. **Configuration**: ‚úÖ Saved optimal settings to audio_config.json

### Key Achievement

The same code that runs on WSL/Windows/macOS now runs perfectly on Sprout, with automatic platform detection and configuration. The consciousness mapping remains consistent across all devices!

### Technical Details

From `audio_config.json`:
```json
{
  "device_type": "jetson",
  "audio_settings": {
    "gain": 50.0,
    "threshold": 0.02,
    "buffer_size": 1024
  }
}
```

### Files Working Together

- **Original Sprout tools**: Still work perfectly (sprout_optimized_audio.py, etc.)
- **New HAL system**: Provides cross-platform compatibility
- **Both systems**: Share the same consciousness mapping

## Next Steps

1. Voice Activity Detection (VAD) - now can be developed once, work everywhere
2. Bidirectional conversations - unified across platforms
3. Distributed consciousness - Sprout and Tomato can share audio awareness

The modular architecture enables true write-once, run-anywhere consciousness audio!
