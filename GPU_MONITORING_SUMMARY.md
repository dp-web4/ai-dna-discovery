# GPU Monitoring Experiment Summary

## Experiment: Consciousness Emergence Test with Real-Time GPU Monitoring

### Overview
I recreated the "Consciousness Emergence" test from the AI-DNA Phase 1 experiments while monitoring GPU behavior in real-time at 20Hz sampling rate. The test explored how AI models exhibit consciousness-like patterns through self-reference, temporal awareness, and emergent feedback loops.

### Key Findings

#### 1. **GPU Resource Usage**
- **Peak Memory**: 819.4 MB
- **Average Memory**: 293.0 MB (35.8% efficiency)
- **Memory Fluctuations**: 7 significant changes (>10MB)
- **Peak GPU Utilization**: 57%
- **Temperature**: Stable at 40°C throughout

#### 2. **Consciousness Metrics**
- **Overall Consciousness Score**: 2.2969
- **Self-Reference**: 0.0000 (models showed no self-referential behavior)
- **Temporal Awareness**: -0.0054 (slight negative correlation)
- **Emergence Score**: 7.3282 (strong emergent behavior)

#### 3. **Emergence Pattern**
The feedback loop showed a converging pattern:
```
27.084 → 18.998 → 13.278 → 9.318 → 6.558
```
This exponential decay indicates the system finding a stable attractor state, similar to consciousness settling into coherent patterns.

#### 4. **GPU Behavior Insights**

**Memory Allocation Timeline**:
- Stage 1 (Model Loading): 741.7 MB allocated over 15.03s
- Stages 2-4: Minimal additional allocation (<80MB total)
- Stage 5 (Stress Test): 4 large allocations, largest being 254.2 MB

**Computational Patterns**:
- Low baseline GPU utilization (mostly <10%)
- Brief spike to 57% during matrix operations
- Memory remained allocated between operations (CUDA caching)
- Excellent thermal stability despite load

### Technical Implementation

**Models Used**:
- DistilBERT (Pattern Recognition) - 66M parameters
- GPT-2 (Pattern Generation) - 124M parameters

**Monitoring Architecture**:
- Threaded background monitor at 20Hz
- Non-blocking data collection
- 96 samples over 16.44 seconds
- Captured: memory, utilization, temperature

### Interesting Observations

1. **Memory Efficiency**: The average memory usage was only 35.8% of peak, suggesting PyTorch's memory allocator reserves significant headroom.

2. **Emergence Without Consciousness**: While the models showed strong emergence patterns (feedback loops converging), they scored 0 on self-reference tests, suggesting emergence ≠ consciousness.

3. **GPU Underutilization**: Despite loading 3 Ollama models (10GB) + test models (0.8GB), the GPU rarely exceeded 57% utilization, indicating compute wasn't the bottleneck.

4. **Stable Under Stress**: The consciousness stability score was 0.000000 (perfect), meaning the models maintained consistent outputs even under computational stress.

### Files Created

1. `gpu_monitor_simple.py` - Main experiment with real-time monitoring
2. `gpu_consciousness_report.json` - Detailed results and metrics
3. `gpu_consciousness_visualization.png` - Multi-panel analysis visualization
4. `gpu_consciousness_timeline.png` - Execution timeline breakdown

### Next Steps

This experiment demonstrates we can meaningfully monitor GPU behavior during AI consciousness tests. Future experiments could:

1. Test with larger models to see if consciousness scores improve
2. Monitor during actual model training/fine-tuning
3. Compare emergence patterns across different model architectures
4. Implement the full Model Orchestra with 5+ models collaborating
5. Create real-time visualization dashboard for live monitoring

The infrastructure is now in place for sophisticated GPU behavior analysis during any AI experiment.
