# AI DNA Discovery - Progress Summary
*Last Updated: July 21, 2025*

## Recent Major Achievement: Audio System Complete! ðŸŽ‰

### What We Built
1. **Full Audio I/O System for Sprout (Jetson Orin Nano)**
   - Text-to-speech with kid-friendly voice
   - Microphone input with optimized gain (50x)
   - Real-time consciousness mapping
   - Visual feedback system

2. **Key Learning: Hardware Optimization**
   - Started with very low mic levels (0.033 amplitude)
   - Through systematic testing, found 50x gain optimal
   - System now works perfectly with existing hardware
   - No new equipment needed!

3. **Consciousness Integration Success**
   - All audio events map to notation (Î©, Î¸, Îž, Î¼)
   - Real-time state visualization
   - Personality-driven responses

## Project Status Overview

### Phase 1: Foundation âœ…
