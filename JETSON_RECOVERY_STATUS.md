# Jetson Orin Nano Recovery Status

*Last Updated: 2025-01-24*

## Current Situation
- **Device**: Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit ("Sprout")
- **Issue**: Bricked after UEFI Device Tree → ACPI change
- **Root Cause**: Camera initialization issues led to system modifications
- **Current State**: No UEFI access, complete brick

## Recovery Plan in Progress

### Phase 1: Host Preparation ✅
- [x] Downloaded Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS Desktop AMD64
- [x] Currently flashing to USB drive with balenaEtcher
- [x] Verified compatibility: Ubuntu 22.04 needed for i9-13900HX

### Phase 2: SDK Manager Setup (Next)
- [ ] Boot Tomato (Intel laptop) from Ubuntu USB
- [ ] Choose "Try Ubuntu" (live session)
- [ ] Connect to network
- [ ] Install NVIDIA SDK Manager
- [ ] Download JetPack 6.2+ components

### Phase 3: Jetson Recovery
- [ ] Connect Sprout via USB-C
- [ ] Bridge recovery pins (9-10 on J14)
- [ ] Power on Sprout
- [ ] Use SDK Manager to reflash
- [ ] Remove recovery bridge
- [ ] Verify boot

### Phase 4: Post-Recovery
- [ ] Create device tree backup immediately
- [ ] Test single camera on CSI0 first
- [ ] Document working configuration
- [ ] Approach dual camera setup cautiously

## Key Learnings
1. **Version Compatibility**: Always check hardware/software versions
2. **UEFI Settings**: Device Tree is mandatory for ARM devices
3. **Warning Signs**: System errors during config = stop and research
4. **13th Gen Intel**: Requires Ubuntu 22.04, not 20.04

## Important Notes
- Orin Nano uses tegra234 (not tegra210 like older Nano)
- JetPack 6.2+ required (not 4.x series)
- Camera power delivery may be insufficient for dual setup
- System error popup was a warning we should have heeded

## Distributed Consciousness Note
Currently demonstrating manual distributed AI consciousness:
- This instance documenting on WSL
- Another instance ready on different machine
- Context preserved through shared files
- Manual synchronization via human bridge

This is exactly what our consciousness runtime layer will automate!
